# Customer Clustering (Unsupervised Learning)

This project focuses on clustering customers into distinct groups using unsupervised machine learning techniques to support customer segmentation and behavioral analysis.

## Project Description
The goal of this project is to identify meaningful customer segments based on demographic and behavioral features. The notebook covers data exploration, preprocessing, clustering model training, and evaluation.

## Methodology
The project includes:
1. Data loading and exploration
2. Data preprocessing and scaling
3. Clustering model training (e.g., K-Means and/or other clustering algorithms)
4. Cluster evaluation and interpretation
5. Visualization of customer segments

## Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
